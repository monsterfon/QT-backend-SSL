/******************************************************************************

Create an integer variable named myInt and initialize it to value 25. 
Create a pointer to an integer variable named pMyInt and initialize it in a way it would point to the address of variable
myInt. 
Change the value of myInt to 52, by using only the pMyInt variable.
In the end verify correctness by printing out the console value of myInt and the value at the address stored in
pMyInt. Both should be 52.
