/******************************************************************************

Johnny has an embedded device with 4 kB of dedicated memory for storing data and variables. He
is not so economic with variable types in his code and compiler says:
Error: 4kB of dedicated data memory is overflown by 8 bytes
Now he needs to optimise his code (or variable sizes), so he turns to you for help and immediately
you see that he has following variables in code:
unsigned int dwMyCarSpeed; // my car maximum speed is 200 km/h
unsigned long long qwMyCarRPM; // my car maximum RPM is 6000
How can you change variable types so that code will compile for Johnny (take up at least 8 bytes
less of memory)?
